### Reinforcement-Learning
A WIP implementation of Rainbow (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298).

After installing the requirements, you also need to run `pip install gym[atari]` manually. If you are using CUDA also make sure to install the right wheel from https://pytorch.org/.

## Examples
Contains minimal examples of utilizations of useful libraries:
- mlflow
- airflow
- zmq

## Script
- tdd: a script useful for Test Driven Development
